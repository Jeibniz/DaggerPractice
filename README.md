# DaggerPractice
My code following tutorials to improve my Dagger 2 knowledge. The app itself is relatively straight forward, it contains two activities and two fragments displayig data from the REST API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

Besides Dagger the app also uses:
* The **MVVM pattern** for structuring the data flow.
* **Retrofit** and **RxJava** for requests to the REST API.
* **AndroidX Navigation** for fragment navigation.
